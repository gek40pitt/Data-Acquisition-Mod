# PyDAQ
This software can be used to control any lockin amplifier, waveform generator, or LabJack DAQ through the PyVisa python package. This allows for complete automation of the data acquisition process when using a lockin amplifier and will save that data in a convienient .csv file for simple post processing. The measurment package includes single point measurements, frequency sweeps, and  time dependent measurements. Feel free edit and add your own measurment types to our DataLogging Class. 

Follow along with the single point example to intialize your lockin amplifer and waveform generator. Once intialized you should be able to take a measurement that will be saved as a .csv file.
