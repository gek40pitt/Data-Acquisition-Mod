# Data-Acquisition-Mod
This software can be used to control any lockin amplifier, waveform generator, or LabJack DAQ through the PyVisa python package. This allows for complete automation of the data acquisition process when using a lockin amplifier and will save that data in a convienient .csv file for simple post processing. The neasurment package includes single point measurements, frequency sweeps, and  time dependent measurements. Feel free edit and add your own measurment types to our DataLogging Class.
